# Understanding Common Attacks

This lab demonstrates basic cybersecurity attacks using sample web and network logs. All exercises are safe to perform in a lab environment.

---

## Threat Actor Types (Beginner-Friendly)
- Script Kiddies: People using simple tools to experiment or cause small disruptions
- Hacktivists: Attackers motivated by social or political goals
- Cybercriminals: Attackers attempting to steal data or money
- Note: All exercises are for learning only

## Web-Based Attacks
- SQL Injection: Detect unusual characters or SQL keywords in web logs
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Look for suspicious JavaScript patterns in requests
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): Monitor requests with unexpected account changes
- Directory Traversal: Look for attempts to access files outside the web root
- Brute Force Login: Detect repeated failed login attempts

---

## Network-Based Attacks
- Port Scanning: Detect multiple connection attempts to different ports from one IP
- Brute Force SSH: Look for repeated SSH login failures
- DDoS (Basic): Monitor spikes in traffic to one destination IP
- Note: All network exercises use sample lab logs

---

## Notes
- No real servers or sensitive data are used
- All exercises are beginner-friendly and safe
- Skills demonstrated: basic log analysis, SIEM searches, user/group management
