Lab 1 - Intro to AWS IAM

AWS IAM is a web service that allows AWS customers to securely manage users and their permissions within AWS. With IAM, you can centrally manage users, security credentials (such as access keys), and define permissions that control which AWS resources users are allowed to access.

Lab - 2 Build your VPC and Launch a Web Server

Lab overview and objectives
In this lab, you will use Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) to create your own VPC and add additional components to produce a customized network. You will also create a security group. You will then configure and customize an EC2 instance to run a web server and you will launch the EC2 instance to run in a subnet in the VPC.
Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) enables you to launch Amazon Web Services (AWS) resources into a virtual network that you defined. This virtual network closely resembles a traditional network that you would operate in your own data center, with the benefits of using the scalable infrastructure of AWS. You can create a VPC that spans multiple Availability Zones.
After completing this lab, you should be able to do the following:
•	Create a VPC.
•	Create subnets.
•	Configure a security group.
•	Launch an EC2 instance into a VPC. 
AWS service restrictions
In this lab environment, access to AWS services and service actions might be restricted to the ones that are needed to complete the lab instructions. You might encounter errors if you attempt to access other services or perform actions beyond the ones that are described in this lab.
 
Scenario
In this lab you build the following infrastructure:
